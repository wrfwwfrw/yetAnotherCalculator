# yetAnotherCalculator
Yet another simple scientific calculator. Something I can have with me all the time on my phone.
TODO: (to myself)
1. Code is horrible, do fix it
2. That colol pallete? Broooo, it's even worse than code
3. It's not even scientific yet. Missing some features like dunno, EVERYTHING. It's simple, and yet don't handle large numbers.
4. Again, css

This looks awful, works terrible, work in progres
